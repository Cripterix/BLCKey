# BlcKEY Core Cryptography Overview

This document details the cryptographic algorithms, standards, and methodologies utilized in the BlcKEY Core project to ensure maximum security, privacy, and reliability.

## Cryptographic Algorithms and Standards

### 1. ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)

- **Curve:** SECP256k1 (same as Bitcoin and Ethereum)

**Usage:**
- Creating and verifying digital signatures.
- Ensuring message authenticity and challenge-response validation.

---

### 2. Hierarchical Deterministic Key Structure (BIP-44)

BlcKEY Core implements the BIP-44 standard to derive multiple keys and addresses from a single seed phrase using a hierarchical structure.

**Derivation Path:**
```
m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index
```

**Example for Taler (TLR):**
```
m / 44' / [TLR_COIN_TYPE]' / account' / 0 / index
```

**Purpose:**
- Generate user and server addresses.
- Recover keys from a seed phrase.

---

### 3. Address Generation (Taler Blockchain)

Taler addresses are generated from a public key using hashing and Base58Check encoding (similar to Bitcoin addresses):

```
address = Base58Check(version + hash160(pubkey))
```

**Purpose:**
- Client address verification.
- Registration and authentication processes.

---

### 4. Key Generation (Black-Box Module)

Private and public key pairs are generated by a closed-source, black-box module:

- Client requests a key via a local API.
- The local server queries the black-box module.
- The module returns only the public key and address. Private keys remain securely stored locally.

**Note:**
- The internal mechanism of key generation is confidential and not publicly disclosed.

---

### 5. Challenge-Response Signature Scheme

The challenge-response mechanism employs ECDSA signing using locally stored private keys:

- Challenges/messages are signed using ECDSA.
- Signatures are verified by the server or client using corresponding public keys.

**Example:**
```
signature = ECDSA_sign(private_key, message)
is_valid = ECDSA_verify(public_key, message, signature)
```

---

## Data Security and Protection

- **Seed phrases:** Never leave the user's device.
- **Private keys:** Stored locally, never transmitted via APIs.
- Temporary challenge and session data stored securely using Redis with short TTL.

---

## Supported Cryptographic Libraries

- **Python:** `ecdsa`, `bitcoinlib`, `cryptography`
- **Dart/Flutter:** `pointycastle`, `cryptography`

---

## Security Best Practices

- Regularly update cryptographic libraries and dependencies.
- Use secure local storage mechanisms for private keys and seed phrases.
- Ensure secure transport (TLS/HTTPS) for all data communication.
